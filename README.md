# HTML-SCSS-CSS-Website-

I created a project using HTML-CSS and SCSS. <br>

CSS (Sass) is a powerful extension of CSS that introduces several features and enhancements to make stylesheets more maintainable and efficient. <br>

In this project, I tried to take SCSS features and use them as clean code. <br>

To see the project, just open the index.html page in the VScode compiler. <br>
